With the soaring rates of fraud and money laundering in the banking industry, Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) are increasing in the industry at a very fast pace causing banks to face new and difficult regulatory, supervisory, and compliance challenges.  

Along with those challenges, there has been a significant increase in BSA/AML enforcement activity by the Federal Banking Agencies (FBAs) and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).  

Highlighting this renewed emphasis, in August 2014, FinCEN issued an advisory emphasizing its expectations for financial institutions’ BSA/AML compliance programs, including: engagement and accountability of financial institution management and directors; allocation of sufficient compliance staffing and related resources; sharing of relevant compliance related information across business units; competent and independent testing of an institution’s BSA/AML compliance program, as well as periodic updates to address emerging issues and trends; and an enterprise-wide understanding of the critical role of BSA/AML reporting requirements.(1)

All of the major industries of SARs are trending upwards over the last nine years. With the intense scrutiny and regulatory requirements around SAR documentation and certification, many human hours are spent assessing and reviewing SARs and associated documentation. 

Based on the upward trend, institutions could use the data presented to aid in preparing for the increased volume of SARs during resource and departmental planning.
